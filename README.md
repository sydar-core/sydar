Welcome to the official Rust-based implementation of the **Sydar Layer 1 Protocol**. sydar is a high-performance, Decentralized Web Node (DWN) integrated, Proof-of-Work (PoW) DAG network.

This repository contains the full-node software, designed for maximum throughput, low latency, and native Web5 sovereign identity integration. Built from the ground up in Rust, this node is optimized for the **sydar Consensus**—delivering extreme scalability without sacrificing decentralization.

## Key Features
 * **High Throughput:** Engineered to handle up to 10,000+ TPS.
 * **Web5 Native:** Built-in support for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and DWN synchronization.
 * **Sovereign Infrastructure:** 21 Million hard-capped supply with a fair-launch, no-premine model.
 * **Quantum Ready:** Future-proof architecture designed for post-quantum security transitions.
## The Genesis Phase
> **Note:** Our network architecture is designed for 1-second finality. We are constantly optimizing the DAG topology to reach our 10,000 TPS milestone on consumer-grade hardware.

## Web5 Identity Integration
Unlike traditional L1s, sydar nodes are natively compatible with Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN). 
Every miner and user can link their on-chain CSM address with a W3C-compliant DID (Decentralized Identifier). 
This allows for secure, serverless messaging and data storage directly on the sydar infrastructure.

## Installation
### Building from Source (Recommended)
Building from source ensures you are running the most optimized version for your specific hardware.
**Prerequisites (Linux/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev

```
**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sydar-core/sydar.git
cd sydar

# Compile the node and miner
cargo build --release

```
##  Running the Node
### Start a Mainnet Node
To start a full-node and begin syncing with the sydar DAG:
```bash
./target/release/sydard --utxoindex

```
### Start a Testnet Node
For developers looking to test integrations or mining setups:
```bash
./target/release/sydard --testnet

```
## Mining on sydar
sydar uses a memory-hard, ASIC-resistant PoW algorithm. To start mining with your CSM address:
```bash
cd sydar-miner
./target/release/sydar-miner -s 127.0.0.1 -p 26110 -a <YOUR_CSM_ADDRESS> --mine-when-not-synced

```
## wRPC & Integration
sydar provides a high-performance **wRPC (WebSocket RPC)** interface for exchanges, wallets, and explorers.
 * **Default Port:** 26110
